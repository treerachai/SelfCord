# SelfCord
A very easy to use discord.js Selfbot.

##Usage

First create a file named `config.json`. This'll be used to start the bot.
Put this is the file:
```
{
  "prefix": "s!",
  "userID": "your ID",
  "token": "your token"
}
```
After that, go ahead and run `node --harmony index.js` and you'll be good to go!

I'll be constantly updating this bot, so continue to check back for more commands!
